# SideBarAccount
What is sideBarAccount?
Lets take an example, after you login your linkedin account. You see your dashboard and a panel where your profile image, name, mobile number, email are displayed. So sidebarAccount is a bootstrap panel where your such details will be displayed. And after using it developer will not have to waste his/her time writng code for it. This. will save valuable time of developer.
for look of this panel=>see "screenshot.png" file in the current directory.
The developer can use routing in angular to change routes on click of different options in panel.
IMPORTANT = >for changing routes change in below list by replacing '#' with the route of the component you want to be displayed. 
For this the developer should have a little idea of Routing in angular.
