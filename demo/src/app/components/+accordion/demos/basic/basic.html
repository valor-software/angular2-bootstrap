  <accordion-group heading="Static Header, initially expanded">
    This content is straight in the template.

  <accordion-group #group>
    <div accordion-heading>
      I can have markup, too!
      <span class="badge badge-secondary float-right pull-right">Some HTML here</span>
    </div>
    This is just some content to illustrate fancy headings.

  </accordion-group>
  <accordion-group heading="Content 2">
