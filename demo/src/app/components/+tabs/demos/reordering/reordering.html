<div>
  <!--
   There are 3 css-classes, which can be used to change the look and feel:
   
   nav-drop-target-before
   		this class is set, if a TAB is dragged over another tab, which means, 
   		the dragged TAB will be inserted before.
    
   nav-drop-target-before
   		this class is set on the last TAB, if the a TAB is dragged to the UL-container (after the last TAB), 
   		which means the tab will be moved to the end.
   		
   nav-tabs-trag-image
   		this class defines the image displayed at the cursor-position, while a TAB is dragged.
   		
   reorderable is currently tested with horizontal layout only!
